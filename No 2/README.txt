Coursera Mini-project #2 - Guess my number

This was coded using codeskulptor. You can run it at: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user21_8Q27rRAElkQPouw_1.py

"One of the simplest two-player games is “Guess the number”. The first player thinks of a secret number in some known range while the second player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the first player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!” depending on whether the secret number is higher, lower or equal to the guess. In this project, you will build a simple interactive program in Python where the computer will take the role of the first player while you play as the second player."

This project utilised buttons and input fields for the user to interact with the program.
