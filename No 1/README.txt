Coursera Mini-project #1 - Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock

This was coded using codeskulptor. You can run it at: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user26_AkfrHoKGy2_4.py

"Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that allows five choices. Each choice wins against two other choices, loses against two other choices and ties against itself."

This project was very basic but it implemented the random module, lots of calls to functions, and an interesting rule to determine the winner.
